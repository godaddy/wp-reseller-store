== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What reseller programs will this plugin work with? =
This plugin is designed for the [GoDaddy Reseller Program](https://www.godaddy.com/reseller-program). If you have not purchased a reseller program, you can activate the plugin with our "in house" reseller. At any time, you can upgrade the reseller to your plan by deactivating the plugin and reactivating.

= What settings should I update in the Reseller Control Center? =
We recommend you set the _Home Url_ to your WordPress storefront. We also suggest you set up a _Custom Domain_ and point the DNS to our server.
The _Custom Domain_ must be on a subdomain that matches the same root domain of your WordPress storefront. For example, your WordPress storefront is hosted on _www_ and your custom domain is hosted on _shop_. Follow these [instructions to set your custom domain](https://www.godaddy.com/help/use-a-custom-domain-for-my-storefront-5040).

You can update both the home url and custom domain setting at [https://reseller.godaddy.com/settings/branding](https://reseller.godaddy.com/settings/branding)

= How do I set the currency and language for the product catalog? =
The currency and language are set in the [Reseller Control Center](https://http://reseller.godaddy.com)

= Do you have a pre-built WordPress site? =
We encourage each reseller to create their own unique site and content for their storefronts. This provides a better experience for your customers and more opportunities for search engine optimization.
While we can't test every theme with our plugin, we try our best to make the plugin compatible. GoDaddy provides several free themes including [Go](https://wordpress.org/themes/go/) and [Turnkey Storefront](https://wordpress.org/themes/turnkey-storefront/) that we test with our plugin. You can use content from your turnkey website to help you build your own WordPress site.

= I am getting an error while trying to activate the plugin. What should I do? =
If you are having an issue, we recommend you deactivate your other plugins and then try to activate the Reseller Store plugin. You can also try changing to another theme and the try re activating the plugin. Before making any of these changes, we recommend you make a backup of your site and database.

While we strive to make the plugin compatible with many themes and plugins, our plugin creates a custom post type which can cause some themes and custom builder plugins to interfere with the registration of the custom post type.

= What shortcodes are supported? =
While we recommend you use our widgets for your storefront, we do have a shortcodes for each widget.
